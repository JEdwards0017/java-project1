# java-project1

## Introduction
This was one of the earlier assignments done in my Java course Depending on your preference of observing the code that was worked on, I have uploaded two versions of it. You can view either the code in a Word (.doc) file or you can view it in a raw Java (.java) file, the latter of which you can test easily if you have a program that can run them.
